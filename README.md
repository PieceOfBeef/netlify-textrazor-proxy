# TextRazor Proxy for AI Summarizer Chrome Extension

## Overview

This repository hosts a lightweight web proxy for the [TextRazor API](https://www.textrazor.com/) to facilitate the summarization of selected text in a Chrome extension. The proxy addresses CORS issues by allowing your Chrome extension to communicate securely with the TextRazor API without being blocked by the browserâ€™s CORS policy.

## Features

- Acts as a proxy for the TextRazor API to bypass CORS restrictions.
- Allows Chrome extensions to summarize text from any webpage.
- Hosted on Netlify for easy deployment and management.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: For creating the server-side proxy.
- **Express.js**: For handling HTTP requests.
- **Netlify Functions**: For deploying the proxy as serverless functions.
